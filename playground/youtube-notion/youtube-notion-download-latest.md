Curate YouTube content to my Notion recommendation database.

## Inputs

- YouTube channels of interest: aiDotEngineer, 3blue1brown, LennysPodcast, xiao_lin_shuo
- Notion Database ID and Auth key loaded already as env vars

## Your Task
Look up the latest episode from each channels in the list and put into my Notion database. For each entry, summarize the video in the content body (note: you need to actually WATCH THE VIDEOS, DO NOT merely use the video descriptions).

## Limitation
You are only allowed to use native bash commands plus the native tools (google search and url context) to solve this task. DO NOT attempt to write and execute Python code.
